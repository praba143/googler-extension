Why do we always have to choose between different Search Engines? What is the better SE? Google? Bing? Yahoo!?... Why cannot we get the results all together?

googler is a Chrome extension which searches in several Search Engines and return all the information together.

You can filter and sort returned information by different ways which help you to find whatever you are looking for.

googler is very useful in Google Hacking applications and research tasks.
